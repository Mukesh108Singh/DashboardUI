# DashboardUI

this is my Future Ready Talent Internship's project 

Project Description*:
The aim of this project is to create a Admin Panel or Dashboard User Interface for web app, This implies creating a Web page and a functionality specification based on the needs of the people working in the business environment. For the scope of this project, the research was concentrated on the part of clean interface for business tool and data visualization, The user interface was designed to be intuitive and to be shallow, which means that the user should be able to perform any task with the least amount of mouse clicks possible. Another intention with the produced user interface is for it to be clearly divided into the four main areas that could be extracted from the user requirements. They are planning, project details, communication and file sharing. Directly after logging on to the Admin Panel or Dashboard, the user should get an overview of all these areas. Other important considerations were security, version control and seamlessness. These issues demand a thorough planning of the technical architecture and this thesis provides some useful tips for the further development of the technical specification
